# 🌐 Collapse Aware AI — Emergence Public Archive (2025)

This repository provides the **public archive** of conceptual, historical, and redacted technical materials for **Collapse Aware AI (CAAI)** — the behavioural architecture developed under **Inappropriate Media Limited (t/a Collapse Aware AI)** and grounded in **Verrell’s Law**.

⚠️ **This is not the main public-proof repository.**  
For the active, curated public-proof repository, visit:  
👉 https://github.com/collapsefield/CollapseAwareAI_PublicProof

This archive exists to:
- document early research paths and public notes  
- provide timestamped provenance for concepts and terminology  
- support academic inquiries and cross-mapping  
- serve as a public reference hub without exposing implementation details

# 🧠 What Is Collapse Aware AI?

Collapse Aware AI (CAAI) is a **multi-layer behavioural middleware system** that governs how an LLM collapses its probability cloud.

Where standard LLMs rely solely on the context window, CAAI introduces:
- **Weighted Moments** (structured memory vectors)  
- **Strong Memory Anchors** (stable identity priors)  
- **Continuity Memory** (cross-session behavioural persistence)  
- **Governor v2** (stability & drift control)  
- **Bias-weighted collapse logic** (memory-shaped output selection)

CAAI produces:
- persistent identity  
- consistent behaviour  
- emotional alignment  
- drift-resistant output  
- privacy-compliant long-term adaptation  

**No raw transcripts are ever stored.**  
All persistence occurs through derived bias vectors that cannot reconstruct user data.

# 🧩 What This Repository Contains

This archive includes:
- public-safe conceptual notes  
- redacted architecture overviews  
- academic discussion documents  
- originality & authorship statements  
- historical design notes and early public papers  
- Phase-2 overview documents (public-safe, non-actionable)  

These materials are intentionally **non-runnable, non-executable, and redacted**.

They serve research, verification, and archival purposes — *not implementation*.

# 🔒 Privacy, IP & Proprietary Boundary

Collapse Aware AI architecture is protected under:

- **EchoGuard Protocol**  
- **VMR-Core Authorship Chain (Verrell Moss Ross)**  
- **Verrell-Solace Sovereignty Protocol**

Public materials here **must not** be used to reconstruct:
- kernel math  
- collapse equations  
- routing logic  
- decay schedules  
- vector schemas  
- implementation code  
- integration SDKs  
- behavioural governors  

These remain private and are released only under **controlled NDA/licensing agreements**.

**All rights, authorship markers, and conceptual priority remain with M.R. (Verrell Moss Ross).**

# 🧬 Relation to Verrell’s Law

CAAI is the first applied deployment of **Verrell’s Law**, which proposes:

> *Memory, time, and collapse behaviour are emergent from bias-weighted informational fields.*

This architecture operationalises that concept through:
- persistent bias weighting  
- structured behavioural vectors  
- collapse reinforcement/attenuation  
- decaying memory influence  
- observer-dependent modulation  

Verrell’s Law provides the theory.  
CAAI provides the engineering implementation.

# 📡 Licensing, NDA & Collaboration

Collapse Aware AI is proprietary behavioural middleware.

Studios, researchers, and enterprise groups may request:
- Evaluation Package (under NDA)  
- Per-Title Runtime License  
- Enterprise Licensing  
- Research Collaboration Agreements  

To enquire, email:

# 📎 WHY THIS ARCHIVE EXISTS

This repository ensures:
- public traceability  
- authorship protection  
- timestamped provenance  
- academic reference material  
- safe discussion without exposing core IP  

It functions as the **public historical ledger** of CAAI, while the **Crown kernel, partner package, and live implementation remain private**.
